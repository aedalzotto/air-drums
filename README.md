# air-drums

AVR Air Drums using microcontroller audio and accelerometers.

This project is a drumkit sampler with audio output provided by the AVR microcontroller.
Initially the inputs are handled by buttons, but in the future it will be done with accelerometers.

## TODO

* Record the drum sequence to be replayed later.
* Gamify the replay sequence and display score.
* Add accelerometer input.

## Compiling

This project already has all the dependencies inside.
```
git clone https://github.com/aedalzotto/air-drums.git
cd air-drums
make
make flash
```

There is no need for additional configuration.
